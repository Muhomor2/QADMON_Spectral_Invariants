## Project Status: FINALIZED

This repository contains the complete, stable, archival version of the research establishing two new spectral invariants in quasicrystalline approximations to GUE statistics:

1. Finite-size optimal coupling:
   γ* = √(π/3)

2. Fibonacci–renormalization spectral invariant:
   κ = (√(10 + 2√5)) / 2

These results are fully documented, reproducible, numerically validated, and ready for long-term preservation.  
No further modifications are required for this version.

## Archival Integrity

This is the canonical version intended for:

- GitHub release  
- Zenodo DOI assignment  
- Public academic reference  
- Independent verification  

All elements are reproducible using the code in python/.

## How to Archive on Zenodo

1. Create a GitHub release (e.g., v1.0.0).  
2. Zenodo will automatically generate a DOI for the release.  
3. Add the DOI badge to README (optional).
